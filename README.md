# Spiral-search

The aim of this project is to practice on matrices (two dimensional arrays/vectors). You are asked to find the list of chars (i.e. strings) having a simple property and their locations in a 2D matrix via basic search mechanisms, extract information out of it and process that information.
In this project, you are going to implement a program that searches a given input matrix of characters and displays the words which satisfies a condition.
